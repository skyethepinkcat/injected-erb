# injected-erb README

All this extension does is make blocks like ``<% %>`` correctly syntax highlight as
embedded ruby, *no matter where they are*. No, you can't disable it for certain languages,
and no you can't enable it for certain languages. This is an incredibly stupid, simple
extension that you probably don't want to use unless you're an over-user of Puppet ERB
templating, like me.
